This is just a demonstration application of how to use Chart.js with Ruby using the Ruby on Rails web framework. 
The application deals with plotting out the bar and pie charts of the prices of the items of a hypothetical sports store. The bars and sectors of the charts are colored based on the color provided for the item. For example, if you added a hockey puck and you specify that its color is black, then the bar or sector representing hockey puck would be black.
